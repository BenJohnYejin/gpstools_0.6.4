1. Introduction

The Compact RINEX format is a compression format for GPS observation data which 
is compatible with the RINEX version 2 observation file format. Since this 
format is ASCII type, effective reduction of file size is achieved by combining 
with standard file compression tools such as UNIX compression. The main part
of the format description given in this document consists of two parts: the 
rule of compression scheme and specification of the format. The structure of 
the format is analogus to RINEX Version 2 observation file format. It is 
assumed that the readers are familiar with RINEX 2 format (Gurtner et al., 
1989, 1990).


2. Compression rules
2.1 Basic Idea

Two basic ideas are used to reduce the size of RINEX files:
(1) Looking into RINEX II observation file format, we notice that some of the 
information is redundant. For example, the date of epochs, number of 
satellites, Loss of Lock Indicator (LLI), and signal strength are almost 
invariant from epoch to epoch. We can reduce the redundant information if we 
record only the variation of those information.
(2) The time series of the data such as phase and pseudorange have strong 
correlation between adjacent epochs. We can reduce the digit of the data by 
using this property. By taking a multiple differences between adjacent epochs, 
the digit of the data can be reduced. Similar algorithm is used for the 
compression of seismogram data (Takano, 1990). By repeating the difference 
operation several times, we can reduce the digit more. Table I shows the average
number of digit of the differential data for each data type. (Signs and decimal 
points are not counted in this table). Empirically, the average number of digit 
is minimized when we take 3rd order difference (Table 1)

2.2 The Detail of the Differential Operations

To be more specific, the method of the differential operation taken in the 
Compact RINEX format is as follows:

(1) Rules of differential operation for character data
For the first epoch of the data arc, the characters are put without change. 
From the next epoch, comparing each characters of the data between adjacent 
epochs, only the character changed from previous epoch is recorded. The 
unchanged characters are replaced with spaces. In the case a non-space character
changes to a space, '&' is recorded. (It is assumed that the character '&' is 
not used in the data section of the RINEX file.) This rule is applied for the 
LLI, signal strength and epoch line except for receiver clock offset field.

(2) Rules of differential operation for numerical data
The detail of the differential algorithm is explained in Appendix I. This 
algorithm is applied for the data arcs of receiver clock offset and those of 
each data type of each satellites. When the data arc is initialized, a mark and
the order of difference for the data arc are recorded (see the next section).
For generarity, the order of the difference to take can be different for 
different data arcs, for example, for different data types.

(3) Rules of initialization of data arc
The term "data arc" is appear in the above explanation. Here, this term means 
a continuous epoch sequence of the data. When there is no record for a data type
at an epoch, the data before and after the epoch are regarded as belonging to 
different data arcs. "To initialize" a data arc at some epoch means that the 
differential operation of the data arc is started at the epoch. If an data 
sequence is divided into two data arcs at some epoch, then the second arc will 
be "initialized" at that epoch. The data arcs are defined for each of following 
items:
  - epoch line except for clock offset
  - clock offset
  - numerical record, LLI, and signal strength  for each data type of each 
    satellite

The initialization of the arcs is marked in the file in the way specified in 
the next section. It should be noted that the data arcs for a LLI and a Signal
strength are initialized together with the corresponding numerical record. To 
be more specific, the mark for the arc initialization is common for them for 
each data type of each satellite.

The data arcs are initialized 
  (a) at the first appearance of the data in the file (mandatory), 
  (b) after the epoch at which the original data field is blank (mandatory), 
  (c) when event flag (>1) is set (mandatory),
  (d) at the epoch just after the event lines(mandatory), and 
  (e) at arbitrary epoch (optional).
The feature (e) works well when there are big jump in the data sequence caused 
by a large cycle slip or reset of clock, in which case the size of differential 
data becomes big. The other possible use of the feature (e) may be to initialize 
the data arc of entire data periodically (for example, every 100 epoch). By 
doing this, the data after the initialization can be used even if the data is 
corrupted in the middle (with some asumptions. See section 6.) This makes the 
format more robust, but should not be abused since the compression performance 
will be worse. 


3. Description of Compact RINEX format
3.1 Specification of the format

In the RINEX format, 3 decimals are used for phase, pseudorange and Doppler data 
and 9 decimals for receiver clock offset. To convert to Compact RINEX format, 
decimal points of those data are eliminated before taking difference (by 
multiplied with 1000 or 1000000000). The numerical data should be dealt as 
integer values to avoid round off error of differential (and recovering) 
calculation.

The specification of the lines of Compact RINEX format is shown in the table 2 
and 3.

 +-------------+-------------------------------------------------+--------------+
NOTE :
(1) The initialization of the data arc of EPOCH/SAT line is marked by replacing 
    the first column (1X) with "&". This is turned on whenever EVENT FLAG >1.
(2) The format (?) is (I) for differential data. The initialization of the data 
    arc is marked  by putting (I1,"&") just before (I), where the first field
    (I1) represents the order of differentiation for the data arc. In this case, 
    (?) is (I1,"&",I). Nothing is put for (?) if the data field in the original 
    RINEX file is a blank.
(3) The "CLOCK OFFSET" record follows the "EPOCH/SAT or EVENT FLAGEVENT FLAG"
    record if and only if Epoch flag is 0 or 1, and it is omitted if Epoch
    flag >1.

3.2 Remarks on the format specification

- The satellite list is not folded even if the number of the satellite is more 
  than 12. 
- Lines may be longer than 80 characters.
- The length of the format 'I' for differential numerical data is variable and 
  must not contain a space. The sign "-" is put for negative numerical values, 
  but don't put "+" for positive value.
- In the observation data lines, a "single" spaces is used as a record separator
  for the data types. A space at the first column is interpreted so that a data 
  field with zero length is hidden just before the space (corresponding data 
  field in RINEX file is blank). If two spaces are juxtaposed, a data field of 
  zero length is hidden in between. The number of the single spaces for record 
  separator is exactly the same as the number of the data types specified in the 
  header record (or in a event data). the other spaces (if any) in the line are 
  interpreted as indication of unchanged characters of LLI or signal strength. 
  This means that the number of the data types is very important information 
  to retrieve the original RINEX file. Miscount of data types results in
  erroneous interpretation of the LLI and signal strength records.
- Throughout the file, trailing blank in each line should be eliminated (not 
  mandatory but highly recommended). The trailing spaces which is eliminated
  can be supplied as needed when we retrieve the original RINEX file.
- The format allows the arbitrary order of the differences (<10) for generality.
- When the event flag (>1) is set, the event information lines (such as change
  of data type) are followed without any change. In this case, all of the data
  is initialized in the next epoch as already mentioned in 2.2.

An example of Compact RINEX file and it's original RINEX II file are shown in 
Appendix II and III, respectively.


4. Compression Rate of the Format 

By combining the reduction of RINEX file by applying Compact RINEX format and 
use of UNIX "compress" command, the size of the file can be reduced to about 
1/8 of the original RINEX file. This size is even much smaller then binary 
format provided by receiver manufactures. Table 4 shows an example.

           Table 4 Comparison of compression performance (1)

                file : tskb3000.95o
                                      SIZE(Mb) RATE(%)
                ----------------------------------------
                (1) CONAN BINARY       0.387     20.9
                (2) RINEX              1.848    100.0
                (3) (2) + "compress"   0.597     32.3
                (4) Compact RINEX      0.546     29.5
                (5) (4) + "compress"   0.215     11.6

We can see that the Compact RINEX format realizes smaller file size than UNIX 
"compress" command even without using binary coding. Moreover, the size of the 
compressed Compact RINEX is about 53 % of CONAN binary file (but without 
navigation message).

The performance of the  when being applied to data in IGS archive for 
100 days is shown in Table 5. The total size of the compressed Compact RINEX 
files is about 40 % of the size for the case only the UNIX "compress" command 
is applied.

                (1) RINEX              18.26    100.0
                (2) (1) + "compress"    6.14     33.6
                (3) Compact RINEX       6.11     33.5
                (4) (3) + "compress"    2.47     13.5


5. File name convention

For Compact RINEX file, we recommend using the similar naming convention with 
RINEX file but using character "D" for file type:

    ssssdddf.yyD      ssss:    4-character station name designator
                       ddd:    day of the year of first record
                         f:    file sequence number within day
                               0: file contains all the existing
                               data of the current day
                        yy:    year

For the case the  UNIX "compress" or compatible compression is applied to 
Compact RINEX file (which might be always the case), the following convention 
is proposed:

         RINEX obs   -->    CRINEX    --> z-compressed CRINEX

       ????????.??o  --> ????????.??d -->    ????????.??d.Z   (UNIX)
       ????????.??O  --> ????????.??D -->    ????????.??E     (DOS)
       %%%%%%%%.%%O  --> %%%%%%%%.%%D -->    %%%%%%%%.%%D_Z   (VMS)


6. Other Remarks

The following information in the original RINEX files will be lost by 
transforming into Compact RINEX format;
  (1) spaces at the end of each line
  (2) distinction of format for numerical data: for example "-0.123" and "-.123".
Although the recovered RINEX file can be different from original one for them, 
the changes don't affect to the numerical values at all.

Since a differential scheme is used, the part of the data after the data 
corruption can not be used until the data arcs are initialized and without 
assuming that the number of data types are not changed during the corruption.

As explained in the NOTE 1 of TABLE 2, "&" at the first column of EPOCH/EVENT
lines means initialization of the data arc, not the change of the character
to a space. This is only the exception of the rule (1) in 2.2. This way 
of arc initialization assumes that the first column of an EPOCH/EVENT line in 
the original RINEX file is always a space, and does not work for abnormal
files in which this asumption is not valid.

For the differential operation, we need to search the corresponding satellite
in previous epoch. For this reason, the uniquness of satellite in a epoch
must be kept in the original RINEX file. The compression program should 
check the duplication in the satellite list.

Appendix I  Algorithm for taking the n-th order differences
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Let's consider an arc of the GPS data containing a RINEX II file  (for example, 
the P1 pseudorange data of the satellite PRN01). 

	Y[0;i], i=1,2,3,...,n

Where Y[j;i] is time sequence of j-th difference of the data, and i is the epoch
number.  The magnitude of the range data is the order of tens of thousands of km
in most cases, but the size of the differences between adjacent epochs is much
smaller because of correlation between epochs:

	Y[1;i] = Y[0;i] - Y[0;i-1],	i=2,3,4,...,n

The digits can be reduced more if we take difference more times:

	Y[2;i] = Y[1;i] - Y[1;i-1],	i=3,4,5,...,n,
	Y[3;i] = Y[2;i] - Y[2;i-1],	i=4,5,6,...,n.

Empirically, the minimum digits can be achieved when we take 3rd-order-
difference for GPS data. We can define the new sequence of the differential 
data as follows:

	Y[0;1], Y[1;2], Y[2;3],
	Y[3;i], i=4,5,6, ..., n.

The resulting data sequence preserve whole information in the original time 
series so that we can recover the original data arc Y0[i] from them by following
calculation:

	Y[2;i] = Y[2;i-1] + Y[3;i],  i = 4,5,6, ... ,n,
	Y[1;i] = Y[1;i-1] + Y[2;i],  i = 3,4,5, ... ,n,
	Y[0;i] = Y[0;i-1] + Y[1;i],  i = 2,3,4, ... ,n.

In general, the order of difference to take can be arbitrary, so the algorithm
to take m-th order differences are as follows;

	Y[j;i] = Y[j-1;i] - Y[j-1;i-1],   i=j+1 ,...,n; j=1, ..., m.

We can save the following data sequence which preserve whole information in the
original time series.

	Y[i-1;i], i=1, ..., m,
	Y[m;i]  , i=m+1, ..., n.

The original data arc Y0[i] is retrieved from them by following algorithm;

	Y[j-1;i] = Y[j;i] + Y[j-1;i-1],   i=j+1 ,...,n; j=m, ..., 1.

These algorithms don't need the data of future epoch to compress or retrieve
 the original data. Therefore it's possible to apply it in real time.

The m-th order difference Ym is equivalent to the (m-1)-th order polynomial 
prediction error:
        Y[m;i] = Y[0;i] - Ypred[0;i;m]
where Ypred[0;i;m] is predicted values Y[0;i] by using (m-1)-th order polynomial
obtained by data of m epochs before the i-th epoch.
