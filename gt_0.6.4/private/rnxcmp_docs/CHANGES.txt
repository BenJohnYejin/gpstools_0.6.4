Change history of the RNXCMP software

2007-06-21
  - Version 4.0.3 released by fixing a bug.
  - It was found that crx2rnx.c version 4.0.0-4.0.2 contains 
    a serious bug which may output incorrect or corrupted data 
    due to lack of a procedure to prevent overflow of lower digits
    of data (or its difference) in middle of the recovering operation.
    The overflow does not happen at the begining of data arcs, but
    probability of it increases as many epochs are processed for 
    a data arc without initialization. Therefore, The higher the 
    sampling rate is, the easier the overflow happens.
  - Rnx2crx.c is free from the above bug, but the version of it was 
    also updated to become the same as crx2rnx.c.

2007-06-10
  Following changes were made on the front-end tools
  (suggested by Mike Craymer of Natural Resources Canada)
  - "compress" command appears in the tool CRZ2RNX was an
    error and corrected to "uncompress".
  - modified to accept upper case in the extention of file names.

2007-06-08
  - Version 4.0.2 released.
  - Incompatibility between arguments and format strings of sscanf 
    or sprintf was fixed. This bug was contained in rnx2crx.c 
    and crx2rnx.c of version 4.0.0 and 4.0.1, and may disturb
    output files if the programs are compiled with 16-bit compilers.
  - A string "ver." was eliminated from the display of the program
    version in the help messages.

2007-06-06
  - Version 4.0.1 released.
  - Supports for VMS and SUN OS 4.1.x was terminated.
  - In the previous versions, the default output file was created
    in the "current" directory whatever directory the input file
    was in. From this version, the output file was created in the
    same directory as the input file that was specified in the
    command argument.
  - The above two modifications made it possible to eliminate 
    system-dependency of the source codes. The adjustment of
    the source codes before compilation to switch OS environment
    (UNIX/DOS) became unnecessary.

2007-02-05
  - Version 4.0.0 created. (It is a test version.)
  - Capability of conversion from RINEX version 3.00 to Compact
    RINEX format version 3.0 (RNX2CRX), and vice versa (CRX2RNX),
    was implemented. Conversion between RINEX version 2.xx
    and Compact RINEX format version 1.0 is also possible as before.
